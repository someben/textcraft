# textcraft
TextCraft is a modern MUD client, using Slack as a relay between the user and a server. It is a few hundred lines of Ruby, Sinatra and WebSockets code running on a Linode server. This code connects the classic protocol for talking with MUDs (i.e. telnet) with the newfangled and amazing team tool, Slack. So think of TextCraft as a connector, multiplexer, tunnel or whatever. Drop me a line if you are interested in helping on the project.
